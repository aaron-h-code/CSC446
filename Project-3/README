Homework:
Implement EM fitting of a mixture of gaussians on the two-dimensional data set points.dat. You should try different numbers of mixtures, as well as tied vs. separate covariance matrices for each gaussian.
Use the final 1/10 of the data for dev. Plot likelihood on train and dev vs iteration for different numbers of mixtures.

************ Files ************
Huang_Hao_hw7.py: Implementing EM algorithm for mixuture Gaussians. It contains three core functions: load_data, prob (computing Gaussian pdf) and em (compute EM).

plot.py: plot log likelyhood for both train and dev set, under different number of Gaussians.

************ Instructions ************
To run EM, enter into the folder containing Huang_Hao_hw7.py, and type "./Huang_Hao_hw7.py". If you use ssh to login cycle machines, please use "ssh -X" in order to see the plot. 
Note: If you meet the problem "LinAlgError("singular matrix")", please re-run it.

************ Results and Interpretation************
1. The default number of iterations is 300. The number of Gaussians is: 3, 6, 12, 25, 50.
2. The log likelyhood in train set is monotonic increasing, but this is not always true for dev set.
3. When the number of Gaussians is large, e.g., 50, separated covariance cannot lead to convergence, while tied covariance will convergence. Because unknown variables are too many.
